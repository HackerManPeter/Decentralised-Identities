# Decentralised Identities and its Relevance in Africa

## Introduction

Although largely undigitised, Africa has a problem with cyber-safety, with Africa and Ghana leading in identity fraud cases [[source]](https://guardian.ng/news/nigeria-ghana-lead-west-africas-identity-fraud-cases/). This article explores the state of affairs of Africa’s digital security and offers a solution.

## The Problem in Africa

We face a challenge of over 500 million Africans lacking any form of legal identification [[source]](https://www.diplomacy.edu/resource/report-stronger-digital-voices-from-africa/digital-identification-africa/), hence there is an ongoing effort to deploy digital identity solutions. However, the problem with traditional digital identity solutions, in the event of a successful cyber attack, the personal information of thousands and maybe millions of users, would be compromised due to its centralised architecture.

According to a survey done in 2022 on countries in the world with the most digitisation, South Africa ranked number 1 in Africa and 66th in the world, while the Republic of Congo ranked last in the world at 117th [[source]](https://surfshark.com/dql2022). This reality is evident in our data privacy laws or the lack thereof, as a result, making us even more vulnerable to data breaches and misuse of private information.

## Case Studies

### Data Breaches Across Africa

Although the majority of Africa remains to be digitised, the technology sector has grown rapidly in the past 10 years, this has also brought about a rise in security threats. In March of 2023, South Africa suffered about 56 data breaches a month due to over-processing of user’s data [[source]](https://www.itweb.co.za/article/data-breaches-rising-at-alarming-rate-says-inforeg/wbrpOqg2pXZMDLZn).

The Nigeria Data Protection Commission (NDPC), informed the public earlier in the year that it was looking into 17 high-priority data breaches but has received reports of over a thousand [[source]](https://techpoint.africa/2024/01/29/nigeria-data-protection-breaches/)

It is evident that there is a serious problem that Africa is facing in terms of poor cybersecurity, bad actors can leverage this to get unauthorised access to user’s personal information for fraudulent purposes such as identity theft

### Election Fraud

Africa has had a lot of notoriously unfair elections with Liberia holding a world record for the most fraudulent election ever reported in history [[source]](https://premiumpolitics.com/five-most-rigged-elections-in-africa/?utm_source=punch&utm_medium=punch_backlink). The election in question had only 15,000 registered voters but the winning party had about 240,000 votes in their favour. In a system where the authentication of voters is centralised, and the custodians of that system are themselves the bad actors, feats such as record-breaking electoral fraud are simple to achieve

## Proposed Solution

### Decentralised Identity

Decentralised Identity is an emerging approach to identity management that leverages decentralised technologies like cryptography and blockchain to give control of identification back to the user while also ensuring high security and privacy.

Using the traditional identity management system (siloed identity), credentials such as name, email, date of birth and other relevant information, are stored in the database of the business or organisation. This puts the user’s data at great risk; if there is a data breach due to a cyber attack or negligence by the business, the user’s information could get into the hands of bad actors. Compared to a decentralised identification, the business would ask the user to provide the necessary identification required, the business would then verify the information with the issuer to authenticate the user. This way, the user has more control and security over their information.

### How it works

A simple model of how the Decentralised Identity system would work contains the following entities

- **Verification Credential:** This is a digital, cryptographically secured version of a credential that a user can present to an organisation that needs to verify them. This could be a government-issued ID, an academic degree, certificates and awards, etc
- **Decentralised Identity Wallet:** This is an app that allows a user to manage verifiable credentials
- **Holder:** A user that owns the decentralised identity wallet and received a verifiable credential
- **Issuer:** The organisation that signed a Verifiable Credential and issued it to the holder.
- **Verifier:** A third party that validates that the verifiable credential a holder presents is authentic

A **Holder** would receive a **Verifiable Credential** from an **Issuer** and store in their **Decentralised Identity Wallet**. When a **Holder** presents that credential to a **Verifier**, the **Verifier** then validates the authenticity of the credential.

### Benefits

Decentralised Identities for authentication hold significant advantages over traditional methods. Some of the major problems it solves are:

- **User-Control:** DIDs give users complete control over their personal information, this allows them to share only what is needed to be authenticated and keep sensitive data private.
- **Enhanced Security:** Because DID utilises a blockchain system to store keys, significantly reduces the risk of a single point of failure. The use of cryptography in storing information like DIDs or the public key of an issuer makes it more difficult for bad actors to change, hack or manipulate the system
- **Seamless Experience:** The use of DIDs offers a chance to raise the bar for user experience in terms of authentication and authorisation. Not only does it erase the need for passwords, it also allows for credential verification without delays

## Potential Use Cases

The potential use cases of Decentralised Identities could revolutionise the existing infrastructure in Africa.

- **Businesses:** As organisations adopt the DID standard, they reduce the risk of data breaches.
- **Government:** Government authorities can issue identification using the DID system to mitigate the chances of identity theft and impersonations.

## Conclusion

As Africa’s technology sector continues to grow, so would the need for the solution that decentralised identity offers. Not only would it reduce the amount of data breaches, but it could also begin to reshape our education, healthcare and government sectors through innovation.
